{"name":"MOTHERSHIP","tagline":"-- Responsive grid using Stylus.","body":"## MOTHERSHIP a light & responsive stylus grid  \r\nThe intention of this grid is to give the developer the maximum amount of control over the customization of their grid, all it comes with are basic rows and columns. The thinking here is that you can take this grid and drop it anywhere and be using it in a very short amount of time.\r\n### To fly the MOTHERSHIP üëΩ\r\n###### markup:\r\n```html\r\n<!-- rw stands for row. the row will hold your columns -->\r\n<div class=\"rw\">\r\n  <!-- the number can be designated by you, the user, in the grid.styl file -->\r\n  <div class=\"{NUMBER}-cl\">\r\n    {COLUMN CONTENT}\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n```  \r\n\r\n_NOTE_: Columns are not pluralized, as it is silly, the `{NUMBER}` is the changeable element that will give the grid its direction. when you have two or more columns, obviously, you should use numbers that add up to the total number of your grid constant `GR = ...` illustrated below.\r\n\r\n###### stylus:  \r\n```js  \r\n// CONSTANTS\r\n  GR       = one two three...  \r\n  WIDTH    = 100%\r\n  MAXWIDTH = 1440px\r\n  NUMBER   = length(GR)\r\n  MARGIN   = 0.5%\r\n```\r\n\r\n_NOTE_: Constants you can do a good bit of customization on these variables, maybe all that you need, if not... You should make it code better for you! üòÅ\r\n\r\n_Initial set-up..._\r\n\r\n```bash  \r\n... $ npm install\r\n... $ npm run build:stylus\r\n\r\n```  \r\n\r\n_If you want to make changes..._\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n... $ npm run build:stylus\r\n```  \r\n\r\nthis will compile the `index.css` file from the `index.styl` file.  \r\n\r\n_If you want to make live changes..._\r\n\r\n```bash  \r\n... $ npm run build:watch\r\n```  \r\nand this will compile the `index.css` file from the `index.styl` file as you save.  \r\n\r\npackages:\r\n* [_Stylus_](https://github.com/stylus/stylus)\r\n* [_onchange_](https://github.com/Qard/onchange)\r\n* [_watch_](https://github.com/mikeal/watch)\r\n\r\n_All of these packages should **also** be installed globally_  \r\n\r\n```bash\r\n... $ npm install stylus onchange watch-cli -g\r\n```\r\n_...that will do the trick_  \r\n\r\n### Credits\r\n![Deep Space Nebula by:hameed@deviantart](http://pre09.deviantart.net/308d/th/pre/i/2010/032/9/b/deep_space_nebula_by_hameed.jpg)\r\nImage credit [hameed@deviantart](http://hameed.deviantart.com/)\r\n\r\n### License\r\n(The MIT License)\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) Automattic <developer.wordpress.com>\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the 'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
